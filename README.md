Programming some firmware with their online IDE and there you go, you successfully have a IoT device running. This approach is one of the way Mi Home better fast and reliable data to it's users. The most currently version of the Mi Home system does not use the Particle IoT platform but uses the ESP8266 Wifi module which happens to Arduino compatible. The setup goes like this. The Hub contains the ESP8266 Wifi module and a 915MHz radio transceiver. The nodes contains all the sensor equipment which is packaged with an Arduino Nano and the same 915MHz radio transceivers.
